## 🚀 **Insights & Recommendations**

| **Query** | **Insight** | **Recommendation** |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Q1 — Sales Performance by Subcategory (Last 12 Months)** | The 12-month view highlights which subcategories drive sales volume, revenue, and order counts. Some subcategories generate high volume but low revenue, indicating lower-priced items. Others produce strong revenue despite fewer orders, suggesting high-value products. | Strengthen investment in subcategories showing stable revenue and volume growth. Reevaluate pricing or introduce cross-sell strategies for high-volume, low-revenue groups. Review pricing sensitivity for high-value items with low order counts to optimize profitability. |
| **Q2 — YoY Growth Rate & Top 3 Subcategories with Highest Growth** | The top 3 fastest-growing subcategories are the primary contributors to overall business momentum. Their strong YoY performance may signal rising market demand or successful marketing activity. | Prioritize marketing and inventory allocation for these high-growth subcategories. Monitor their growth trajectory to detect early signs of slowdown. For low-growth or negative-growth groups, reassess competitive positioning, pricing, or product relevance. |
| **Q3 — Top 3 Territories by Order Quantity Each Year** | The leading territories demonstrate consistent demand and stable customer activity. Territories dropping out of the top tier may indicate shifting customer behavior or competitive pressure. | Maintain operational and sales support in the top-performing territories. Investigate performance declines in territories falling behind and adjust commercial strategies accordingly. Use the success patterns of top territories to expand into similar markets. |
| **Q4 — Total Discount Cost from Seasonal Discount by Subcategory** | The data shows which subcategories incur the highest discount costs. High discount spending often corresponds to heavy promotional strategies or underperforming products requiring demand stimulation. | Evaluate whether discount spending effectively translates into increased sales. Reduce or restructure promotions for subcategories with high discount cost but weak revenue impact. Prioritize discount programs for items demonstrating strong conversion when discounted. |
| **Q5 — Customer Retention Cohort (2014)** | The retention pattern reveals how quickly customers return after their first purchase. Strong retention in Month 1 and Month 2 reflects product-market fit and healthy customer experience. Sharp drop-offs indicate potential issues in post-purchase engagement or limited repeat purchasing. | Strengthen onboarding and follow-up engagement immediately after the first purchase. Introduce targeted incentives to encourage early repeat purchases. Analyze one-time customers to identify barriers preventing continued engagement. |
| **Q6 — Stock Trend & MoM Change (2011)** | Monthly stock movement highlights which products experience rising or declining inventory levels. Significant MoM increases point to overstocking or reduced demand, while MoM decreases reflect fast-moving items or insufficient replenishment. | Adjust purchase planning for items with consistently rising stock levels. Increase production or replenish faster for items showing sharp stock decreases. Use MoM patterns to identify seasonality and refine supply chain planning. |
| **Q7 — Stock/Sales Ratio by Product (2011)** | A high stock/sales ratio indicates excess inventory relative to sales velocity, increasing holding costs. A low ratio shows strong demand but potential stock-out risk. | Reduce production or apply promotional tactics for high-ratio products. Increase safety stock or production for low-ratio, fast-moving items. Review monthly ratio patterns to optimize inventory thresholds. |
| **Q8 — Pending Orders & Value (2014)** | Pending orders reflect bottlenecks in approval or fulfillment workflows. High pending counts may indicate internal delays or supplier-related issues. | Audit the order approval and fulfillment process to reduce backlog. Identify the root cause—supplier delays, material shortages, or internal inefficiencies. Define clear SLAs to improve order processing time and minimize pending accumulation. |
