## 📒 **Introduction**
### 🎯 Objectives
        
  The project is designed to simulate a real analytical workflow in a manufacturing and sales environment. The main objectives include:
        
  - Building practical SQL queries that mirror real business questions, such as revenue trends, customer purchasing behavior, and time-based comparisons.
  - Demonstrating how to transform raw transactional data into structured analytical outputs using date functions, window functions, and subqueries.
  - Enhancing analytical thinking by breaking down business problems into smaller SQL components that can be validated and reused.
  - Creating a portfolio-ready SQL project that showcases both technical skills and the ability to communicate analysis clearly.

### 📂 Dataset Description

This project uses selected tables from the **AdventureWorks2019** database. The analytical model is based on a simple star-schema structure including fact and dimension tables.

Fact Tables

  - Sales.SalesOrderDetail – Line-level sales transactions.
  - Sales.SalesOrderHeader – Order-level sales information.
  - Sales.SpecialOffer – Discount and promotional details.
  - Production.WorkOrder – Manufacturing work orders and stock movement.
  - Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader – Purchase order records.

Dimension Tables

  - Production.Product – Product attributes.
  - Production.ProductSubcategory – Product subcategory classification.

### 🔑 Key Skills Demonstrated

This project highlights a range of SQL skills expected from a data analyst or BI analyst:
    
  - **Date and Time Manipulation:** Using FORMAT_DATE, PARSE_DATE, DATE_TRUNC, DATE_SUB, and similar functions to prepare data for monthly and yearly reporting.
  - **Window Functions:** Applying LAG, LEAD, and ranking functions to track customer behavior, detect sequential purchases, and identify first/last touchpoints.
  - **Data Cleaning and Filtering:** Isolating valid records, removing missing values, and preparing the dataset for reliable analysis.
  - **Aggregation and Grouping:** Summarizing metrics like total revenue, order count, and monthly performance.
  - **Analytical Query Design:** Writing queries that mimic real business logic, such as calculating customer first purchase month or comparing performance across time periods.
  - **Scalable Query Structure:** Using readable formatting, aliasing, and consistent layout to make each query maintainable and easy to review.

## 💡 **Insights & Recommendations**

| **Queries** | **Insights** | **Recommendations** |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Q1 — Sales Performance by Subcategory (Last 12 Months)** | The 12-month view highlights which subcategories drive sales volume, revenue, and order counts. Some subcategories generate high volume but low revenue, indicating lower-priced items. Others produce strong revenue despite fewer orders, suggesting high-value products. | Strengthen investment in subcategories showing stable revenue and volume growth. Reevaluate pricing or introduce cross-sell strategies for high-volume, low-revenue groups. Review pricing sensitivity for high-value items with low order counts to optimize profitability. |
| **Q2 — YoY Growth Rate & Top 3 Subcategories with Highest Growth** | The top 3 fastest-growing subcategories are the primary contributors to overall business momentum. Their strong YoY performance may signal rising market demand or successful marketing activity. | Prioritize marketing and inventory allocation for these high-growth subcategories. Monitor their growth trajectory to detect early signs of slowdown. For low-growth or negative-growth groups, reassess competitive positioning, pricing, or product relevance. |
| **Q3 — Top 3 Territories by Order Quantity Each Year** | The leading territories demonstrate consistent demand and stable customer activity. Territories dropping out of the top tier may indicate shifting customer behavior or competitive pressure. | Maintain operational and sales support in the top-performing territories. Investigate performance declines in territories falling behind and adjust commercial strategies accordingly. Use the success patterns of top territories to expand into similar markets. |
| **Q4 — Total Discount Cost from Seasonal Discount by Subcategory** | The data shows which subcategories incur the highest discount costs. High discount spending often corresponds to heavy promotional strategies or underperforming products requiring demand stimulation. | Evaluate whether discount spending effectively translates into increased sales. Reduce or restructure promotions for subcategories with high discount cost but weak revenue impact. Prioritize discount programs for items demonstrating strong conversion when discounted. |
| **Q5 — Customer Retention Cohort (2014)** | The retention pattern reveals how quickly customers return after their first purchase. Strong retention in Month 1 and Month 2 reflects product-market fit and healthy customer experience. Sharp drop-offs indicate potential issues in post-purchase engagement or limited repeat purchasing. | Strengthen onboarding and follow-up engagement immediately after the first purchase. Introduce targeted incentives to encourage early repeat purchases. Analyze one-time customers to identify barriers preventing continued engagement. |
| **Q6 — Stock Trend & MoM Change (2011)** | Monthly stock movement highlights which products experience rising or declining inventory levels. Significant MoM increases point to overstocking or reduced demand, while MoM decreases reflect fast-moving items or insufficient replenishment. | Adjust purchase planning for items with consistently rising stock levels. Increase production or replenish faster for items showing sharp stock decreases. Use MoM patterns to identify seasonality and refine supply chain planning. |
| **Q7 — Stock/Sales Ratio by Product (2011)** | A high stock/sales ratio indicates excess inventory relative to sales velocity, increasing holding costs. A low ratio shows strong demand but potential stock-out risk. | Reduce production or apply promotional tactics for high-ratio products. Increase safety stock or production for low-ratio, fast-moving items. Review monthly ratio patterns to optimize inventory thresholds. |
| **Q8 — Pending Orders & Value (2014)** | Pending orders reflect bottlenecks in approval or fulfillment workflows. High pending counts may indicate internal delays or supplier-related issues. | Audit the order approval and fulfillment process to reduce backlog. Identify the root cause—supplier delays, material shortages, or internal inefficiencies. Define clear SLAs to improve order processing time and minimize pending accumulation. |
